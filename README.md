👋 Hi, I’m Katerina. 

I’m a Data Analyst based in Toronto, Canada, currently working in the insurance/legal industry.

I’m also a part-time student pursuing a MS degree in Data Science at Georgia Tech, USA.

💼 My work typically focuses on identifying financial and reputational risks, administrative process errors, revealing trends and anomalies, generating reports and insights, creating visualizations, and performing KPI analytics. The primary tools I use are Python, R, SQL, and Power BI.
